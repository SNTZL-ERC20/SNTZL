SCHNITZEL COIN (SNTZL)
contract number : 0xF34ca6B7Fe3D6B1c8635A6Bf2bD7bDD252f16426 

ERC20 token
Circulating supply capped at 100.000.000 coins
The first coin is listed at $1,Â last one at $100
Except for the last SNTZL-coin (listed at 100$), any other unsold coins can be burned, deflating the circulating supply, creating upward price pressures
Minting extra coins in not possible by contract
Available through a public-coin-listing, access to SNTZL-coin is fully decentralised + redundant through currently 2 DEX protocols: 
The 1inch Limit Order Protocol & the Uniswap V3 Liquidity Pool Protocol
All of the tokens are split between these 2 DEX protocols for distribution (no hidden wallets or honeypots)
This also increases the redundancy of the distribution, if one isn't working properly, then those coins can be made available on the other protocol
If any CEX wants to list SNTZL, they will have to buy SNTZL at market price on a DEX (if they hold any reserves at all... lol)
Beyond $100, all of the coins will be distributed & the price will be fully determined by the free market
